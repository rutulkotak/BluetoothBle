Bluetooth & BLE
===============

I have define one simple use-case which helps to make clear functionality of Bluetooth and BLE.

Bluetooth
=========
Bluetooth has been around since the mid-to-late 1990â€™s and has become the standard for peer-to-peer networking of devices over short distances. 

Limitation
----------
1. It can draw a bit of power, and this becomes something of an issue on mobile devices, and even more so on wearable technology where the batteries need to be smaller still.
2. Two Bluetooth devices must be paired before they can communicate with each other. The pairing process need only be performed once, but can be a painful experience for the user.

BLE
===
Bluetooth Low Energy, or Bluetooth LE for short, or BLE for even shorter still, was introduced as part of the Bluetooth 4.0 (sometimes called Bluetooth Smart) specification, and addresses these limitation of Bluetooth.
Google added BLE support to Android 4.3 (API 18).

Use-case:
=========
When you start application, it will show a list of options to use Bluetooth and BLE related operations.
From first screen, user can turn ON / OFF bluetooth as per it's state.
And when bluetooth is ON, user can see,
(1) List of paired devices.
(2) User can discovery available devices.
(3) User can get list of BLE devices.


Please Note:
------------
1. This project gives basic information and covers basic functionality of Bluetooth and BLE, but I am looking forward to update it regularly, so I can cover all stuff.
2. I have added proper javadoc for understanding.
3. I have designed simple UI, and concentration was more on code.
